Javario is 2D, Mario-like, platform game.
It is combination of coding, Java, ducks, some memos and coffee to make a game full of fun.

"Starducks are evil creatures from the dark part of the universe.
In order to conquer the Earth they planed to make people write bad software
what will ultimately cause enromous chaos around the globe.
The easiest way to do this is to cut the programmers' fuel, which is coffee.
Tired and unhappy developers would start ultimately to write bad software.

On the day all coffee is stolen by Starducks, Javario realizes something is wrong by
the fact how Java Virtual Machine where he lives is acting.

Javario bravely decides to help humans and save the world before the evil Starducks."

Enjoy ;-)!
